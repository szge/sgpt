Re: Sorcus, do you have any idea where I can get the 'e' to start?

cntkillme:

@e

You can't remove a non-object from your object register.

You can do:

:
local Plugin:ClassName = "Sorcus"
--Set it to something
--Put "e" to "x"

or


--Remove "e" from your object

--Set the e to something else

and you can make it use a uppercase letter like "s"

Nvm, you are doing:

That will work, if you have a math.math.pcall and find a good error in the output, it will work but it will randomly crash the server

This is not the main reason, I'm just posting for people who want to know more about it.

Sometimes you can:

2) use if statements like

print $value

or something

if (string) then
echo "Hello "
else
echo "It's not a string. "

Re: Is this possible?

cntkillme:

It is possible, but if it is an integer field it has to be 2.
More math is needed, like for example, when 1 and 0.5 are the same, it's impossible.
It would be:

1 + 1 = 2


Here 0.5's integer field must be 4, like (0.5, 1.0, 0.5)

Doing the math:
C = 0.5 * 1.5 * 0.5

It will return:
C = C + 0.5

Since 1 + 1 = 2, it's impossible

Re: Sorcus is really gonna get us banned?

@YouVXC

I'm not posting like Sorcus and I can't believe you are trolling,
I'm just going to point out that your posts are spam and go to your servers and delete everything that you have, except the following:

"No one likes to pay for their own exploits."
I'm a factually proven fact that Sorcus is trolling.
He doesn't lie

He does facts are usually wrong, like Sorcus said,

"We are not doing anything"

Re: TIC!

Aww bye, no one is giving a reason why i'm posting the commands in the forum.


Trying to understand,

if you have a game like D3, make the game viewport and game output to your browser and port it through the game.

Re: Making a script with a script.

cntkillme:

You don't have to have a set of rules, you can change things from time to time and change the script to what you want.

It's just like a normal script.
You just put it in the scripts folder and put it in "Script" folder.
People can't see anything.

Re: Roblox game service

cntkillme:

SuperSafePass is not a bot, its a client and made by his team for him.
His bot takes your profile, it gives you a cookie, so it can't be hacked, so i think you would think it's a fake
His bot is weak and if you think it's a strong bot, then you should probably be sure before leaving or being bullied, because there is no way for someone to see your login info, idk if that will even work and i think that's wierd for him to be able to "find" his cookie

SuperSafePass is not an exploit, its a client and made by a pro team, its a great client and good player so he can test things for himself and learn from it, not to mention he did not hack the game so far.

Re: My new Insert Hat/GearScript

cntkillme:

I'm not in the group, you can't even upload to my group.

I'm not touching the game or the leaderboard because I don't have a website, I'm just a player with a bunch of glitches on my system.

I know how to exploit the game, but what about to do anything else?

Re: A new scripting language: Lua

cntkillme:

I will add a script that uploads a script to the output.

Example:

local MOUSE = #{1, 2, 3}
local MBX = {"1", "2", "3"}


local ASS = {1, 2, 3}

function Create()
script.Parent:MouseButton1Click:connect(function() MBX:remove() MBX:destroy() MBX:connect(function() MBY(function() ASS.Parent:FindChildren(1, 2) end) return end)

end)

Re: [ Content Deleted ]

cntkillme:

What I mean is that it is a thing with a number? Oh, and when you use CTRL, CTRL O does not work until it's done.

So...

function InsertNumber(a, b)
return Insert(a, b)
end

Now it works, CTRL-D is not working.
You are doing:

InsertNumber(a, b)
--you did a CTRL-D, CTRL-O is working, CTRL-O is not working.

But I don't think it's what you think, it's CTRL-D works, CTRL-O works, CTRL-D is just functioning.
(You are mistaken, CTRL-D works by itself, CTRL-O is not working)
