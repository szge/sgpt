Dear Jay,
The phrase, "lol" isn't a word, you would have to rephrase is to, "laugh out loud."

Re: Kill Cam

cntkillme:

I made an oops, fail...

Re: Kill Cam

cntkillme:

First of all, it's, "I'll" not "i'll"

Second of all, it's a game, not real life, it's not worth spending an hour to use proper grammar, we save that for school, wouldn't you say?

This post took me two times longer to write then it would of...

Re: Kill Cam

cntkillme:

Third, "lol" isn't a word but can be abbreviated, the source you have isn't valid for real words, I'm sure you can find, "rofl" in there.

Re: Kill Cam

cntkillme:

You were so close... Three dots is used for ect. generally, but you shouldn't end the last sentence like that, and that's not really a "ect" moment. Wanna give it another go?

Change To


You were so close, three dots is used for the word etcetera generally, but you shouldn't end the last sentence like that, and that's not really a "etc" moment. Want to give it another try?

i love how cea is doing this =D
if you dont love him, ur goin ta dieh

Re: Kill Cam

cntkillme:

@jay, I can, they don't show the "normal" or "real" words, they also show slang. Why don't you search, "lmao" and see if you will find it, it's not a word, argue all you want, ask your english teacher if you want, but it is common sense, "lol" is not a word.

Re: Kill Cam

cntkillme:

you got no #swag
you will never have a yolo moment
and you will never get layed, i will not spell it right, u will sleep on a different top side of the bottom bed of the current sleep of bed you are in right now while goofing off and watching me type this boring lame things cuz u like to see words and things so thats why your mom got you alot of books and locks your room door, #ifyouknowwhatimean

k lets see

first of all, u need to be there or the script wont work, do onPlayerEntered and wait till the character is there

game.Players.PlayerEntered:connect(function(newPlayer)
if newPlayer.Name ~= "CodyTheBuildingKid" then return end
repeat wait() until newPlayer.Character:FindFirstChild("Head") ~=nil

local c = Workspace.CodyTheBuildingKid:GetChildren()
a = math.random(10)

if a > 5 then

For A House, Use 1 Long Brick Instead Of 100 Small Bricks
Try To Not Have As Many Scripts
Try Not To Have Many while true do Scripts
Try Not To Use Weld Objects [Make The Surface Weld]

Calling A Function From A String

I'm trying to call a function from a variable.

If i have a function called hi and a variable with a string called Func,
how would I make the string convert? into a function?

loadstring(Func)
load(Func)()
Func()

Nothing is working, any help would be appreciated.

All about tables [AKA Arrays]

cntkillme:

Yes, this may be useless but I've seen like 100 different threads asking about tables

So, a table is a variable that holds multiple values

Table1 = {"Name", "Name2", script.Parent, 31}

It can hold strings, numbers, instances, etc.

So, to add into a table, you would do:

table.insert(Table1, Value)


Example:
Users = {"cnt", "player", "crus"}
table.insert(Users, "roblox")


To remove, you would do:

table.remove(TableName, Location)

Example:
Users = {"cnt", "player", "crus", "roblox"}

So, a table (it's called array in most other scripting languages) is a variable that holds multiple values, it can range from integers to strings and instances.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How you would start a table

TableName = {"Value1", 2.1234, game.Workspace:GetChildren()}

Re: Fixed And New: All About Tables (Arrays)

cntkillme:

To insert into a table

table.insert(TableName, Value)

Example:

Usrs = {"cnt", "crus"}
table.insert(Usrs, "roblox"}

Then, Usrs will equal {"cnt", "crus", "roblox"}

Re: Fixed And New: All About Tables (Arrays)

cntkillme:

To remove from a table

table.remove(TableName, Location)

Examples:

Usrs = {"cnt", "crus", "roblox"}
table.remove(Usrs, 2)

Then, Usrs will equal {"cnt", "roblox"}


Note:
Roblox's tables start from 1, most other languages start from 0

Example:

Roblox
Usrs = {"lol", "lol2", "lol3"}
Index of lol = 1, lol2 = 2, lol3 = 3

JavaScript
Usrs = ["lol", "lol2", "lol3"]
Index of lol = 0, lol2 = 1, lol3 = 2

PHP
$Usrs = Array("lol", "lol2", "lol3")
Index of lol = 0, lol2 = 1, lol3 = 2

Re: Fixed And New: All About Tables (Arrays)

cntkillme:

To view a value from a table

TableName[Index]

Example:
Usrs = {"lol", "lol2", "lol3"}
print(TableName[1])

That would print "lol"


To see if a value is contained in a table

Usrs = {"lol", "lol2", "lol3"}

if #Usrs == 0 then return end --Hashtag indicates the length of the table, if the table is empty then it will just stop running a function
for i = 1, #Usrs do --Start a for loop from 1 until amount of users [3 in this case]

First ever steering wheel on roblox

cntkillme:

So here's the thing
I've been thinking about making a car controlled by the steering wheel.

Right now, the steering wheel is done, but I'm not sure if any glitch will happen if more than me alone plays.
There are 4 in-game Test steering wheels i want to be tested, hopefully 4 all at the same time.

Information:
-Rotates 900 Degrees [Car Like]
-Auto Centering [When Let Go'd Of A/D]
-The script is in StarterPack, for Player:GetMouse()

Testers will be appreciated, party me for the details

Seat ChildRemoved

cntkillme:

So i made a conenction with seat child removed, everything works 100% right?
But you see, if you quickly get off the seat after you sit on it, it doesn't do the removed function, how would i fix this.

I tried:
Anchoring their head after the get up

But it will only anchor their head after they get up normally

Re: Seat ChildRemoved

cntkillme:

K, it is:

function Exit()
	Player.Character["Head"].Anchored = true
	DownKey = nil
	Con:disconnect()
	Con2:disconnect()
	Cons:disconnect()
	wait()
	Mouse = nil
	RetrievePos()
	repeat wait() until Pos == 125
	Dis1 = false
	Dis2 = false
	seat = nil
	ting = 0
	RemoveTheRest()
	Player.Character["Head"].Anchored = false
	setWork(game.Workspace)
end

So it all works when you don't quickly get outa your seat

if A.IsConnection or something like that??

Re: Returns loweracase letters without string.lower()?

cntkillme:

Look at line 1, do you see VARIABLE = string.lower(msg)??

When you use '=', You are setting
When you use '==' You are comparing

When you use '===' You are checking if they are identicle

I have a localscript in startergear
It gets all the seats in the game and adds them to a table
Makes a connection for each one and inserts that into a table
And everything works normally, BUT:
If you QUICKLY get out of the seat, the CONNECTIONS wont DISCONNECT and the Removed function itself wont finish.

No delete method is working

cntkillme:

Part of script:

for a, b in pairs(Items) do
if b ~= nil then
b:Destroy()
Count = Count + 1
end
end

Adds to items:

function Insert(Part)
...
table.insert(Items, Part)
end

The script works 100% except the part won't remove

I've tried, remove(), destroy(), ,Parent = nil
NOthing works
I also tried to remove the if b ~= nil, same thing happens

You guys all are wrong.. You can't use inequalities with strings.

you would have to do:

Use tables, and practice with for loops, you probabaly can make ur long script to 20 lines or less

start with multi-dementional arrays

TextColor 3 = BrickColor.new("Brick Color").Color() < Gets the color3 value i think

Re: Reset GUI help?

script.Parent.MouseButton1Up:connect(function() Players.LocalPlayer.Character:BreakJoints() end)

Re: I need this script...please...

cntkillme:

It's a long script for spread fire, here is step by step, me no wanna script alot:

1)Put a FLAMMABLE value in all parts you want to be able to catch on fire
2)Make FLAMMABLE value = the amoutn of time the fire lasts before destroying item

3)When one catches fire [by making a script], use a magnitude and a for loop to get nearby parts and set them on fire
4)Clone the script into the new fire
5)That will spread everywhere ;]

2) Set Up Your Database
3) Insert A New Table With Objects Needed For Accounts
4) For Each You Need To Do, You Can Insert A Table
[Like Table: comments, buys, favorites, etc]

THen you will need PHP knowledge, or you can practice with these basic functions

mysql_connect()
mysql_die()
mysql_query()
mysql_num_rows()
mysql_assoc()

Re: Is it possible

cntkillme:

Some things are impossible with scripting, such as get the entered player's passwrd [encrypted or not] from the database, or even make a anti exploit.

Re: What are some challenges I should give myself when I script?

cntkillme:

@adark

I'm saying not by a person's skill but by their status.
As in 1 = prints functions variables etc
2 = whatever, etc.

And don't say you're 57 in the /10 term, because 10 is being the max of knowing everything

Re: Is it possible

cntkillme:

@About the anti exploit, but you can't prevent dll injectioins

@About the pw part:

You can't use bytecode to get into databases because php or asp, and some others i think are the only ways, I know lua is not one, as well as jvaascript
Plus, even if you can get the passwrds, they would be encrypted, unable for you to have accounts.

Because an encryption [or 99% of them] is a 1 way thing.

If you don't wanna help him, don't make posts saying this isn't the right forum. You're just wasting time, it is the right forum for people that are willing to help him.

Re: Is it possible

cntkillme:

Lol @Des, it runs in my genes, i never used online sources to help me script, i managed to learn it all myself, and get better by editing other scripts.

I'm not much of a bodybuilder because you know what scientists say, the more you lift, the smaller it gets.
I'm average-fit for my age, but underweight :)

cntkillme:

Errm, it was the same, except these days people are getting better, and they are removing :Remove() :_(

Re: Is it possible

cntkillme:

It's because you were dreaming.

I guarantee no one on roblox, or in fact almost everyone, knows how to break through firewalls and through network securities, much less edit your screen to put a decrypted pwrd on it.

As i said, encryption is a one way thing.

That's not hard except the fact if killing the whole family, the jump part you can check if a torso's position y > a value and if so, moveto method.

Re: Is it possible

cntkillme:

"Stolen" accounts are people giving their pwds to others who spread that.

Or back in 2008, before roblox has mysql_real_escape_string (PHP Function), you can type 'or'1'=='1 on the username bar and type any php code you please, such as

mysql_query("UPDATE `account` SET Passwrd='' where UserId='2134451'")
To change who ever has a userid of 2134451's pass to nothing, so it will make them change it on next login

Re: How would I go about doing this?

cntkillme:

=D

I started scripting @ 8 yrs old [html and javascript]
then learned vb, c++, vbs, batch, php, mysql, then lua by 12 yrs, then got better at all of them by 1 year, now i am super pro ;]

print(Answer)
end

DoAdd(5,3)

Print: Show's text on the output, doesn't get a value
Return: Returns a value so you can see it, like return 5 + 3 will allow other functions to get a value without making a variable, also, return stops a script from continuing

but if it stats at 0, it cant go to negative, therefor making it always stay at 0, you  can do:

while true do
wait(0.4)
script.Parent.Transparency = script.Parent.Transparency + 0.1
wait(0.4)
script.Parent.Transparency = script.Parent.Transparency + 0.1
wait(0.4)
script.Parent.Transparency = script.Parent.Transparency - 0.1
wait(0.4)
script.Parent.Transparency = script.Parent.Transparency - 0.1

@Nag is mad cuz he cant script lolz



Re: It wont swing..

cntkillme:

I'm helpful, he just doesn't understand what i'm saying..

In weapons like most swords, when you attack, it will create a string value called 'toolanim' inside the tool.

And the animate script part of the character will find it automaticly and do a script to make it lunge/slash/etc

Re: Ledge Grabbing?

cntkillme:

You can make invisible bricks and use magnitude to get them [or raycast] and see if they are too low, anchor them, put a gui that moves them if they click jump down or whatever

The magnitude will get the closest brick and if it's lower than the person's elevation, then the gui will show up
