Dear Jay,
The phrase, "lol" isn't a word, you would have to rephrase is to, "laugh out loud."

Re: Kill Cam

cntkillme:

I made an oops, fail...

Re: Kill Cam

cntkillme:

First of all, it's, "I'll" not "i'll"

Second of all, it's a game, not real life, it's not worth spending an hour to use proper grammar, we save that for school, wouldn't you say?

This post took me two times longer to write then it would of...

Re: Kill Cam

cntkillme:

Third, "lol" isn't a word but can be abbreviated, the source you have isn't valid for real words, I'm sure you can find, "rofl" in there.

Re: Kill Cam

cntkillme:

You were so close... Three dots is used for ect. generally, but you shouldn't end the last sentence like that, and that's not really a "ect" moment. Wanna give it another go?

Change To


You were so close, three dots is used for the word etcetera generally, but you shouldn't end the last sentence like that, and that's not really a "etc" moment. Want to give it another try?

i love how cea is doing this =D
if you dont love him, ur goin ta dieh

Re: Kill Cam

cntkillme:

@jay, I can, they don't show the "normal" or "real" words, they also show slang. Why don't you search, "lmao" and see if you will find it, it's not a word, argue all you want, ask your english teacher if you want, but it is common sense, "lol" is not a word.

Re: Kill Cam

cntkillme:

you got no #swag
you will never have a yolo moment
and you will never get layed, i will not spell it right, u will sleep on a different top side of the bottom bed of the current sleep of bed you are in right now while goofing off and watching me type this boring lame things cuz u like to see words and things so thats why your mom got you alot of books and locks your room door, #ifyouknowwhatimean

k lets see

first of all, u need to be there or the script wont work, do onPlayerEntered and wait till the character is there

game.Players.PlayerEntered:connect(function(newPlayer)
if newPlayer.Name ~= "CodyTheBuildingKid" then return end
repeat wait() until newPlayer.Character:FindFirstChild("Head") ~=nil

local c = Workspace.CodyTheBuildingKid:GetChildren()
a = math.random(10)

if a > 5 then

For A House, Use 1 Long Brick Instead Of 100 Small Bricks
Try To Not Have As Many Scripts
Try Not To Have Many while true do Scripts
Try Not To Use Weld Objects [Make The Surface Weld]

Calling A Function From A String

I'm trying to call a function from a variable.

If i have a function called hi and a variable with a string called Func,
how would I make the string convert? into a function?

loadstring(Func)
load(Func)()
Func()

Nothing is working, any help would be appreciated.

All about tables [AKA Arrays]

cntkillme:

Yes, this may be useless but I've seen like 100 different threads asking about tables

So, a table is a variable that holds multiple values

Table1 = {"Name", "Name2", script.Parent, 31}

It can hold strings, numbers, instances, etc.

So, to add into a table, you would do:

table.insert(Table1, Value)


Example:
Users = {"cnt", "player", "crus"}
table.insert(Users, "roblox")


To remove, you would do:

table.remove(TableName, Location)

Example:
Users = {"cnt", "player", "crus", "roblox"}

So, a table (it's called array in most other scripting languages) is a variable that holds multiple values, it can range from integers to strings and instances.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How you would start a table

TableName = {"Value1", 2.1234, game.Workspace:GetChildren()}

Re: Fixed And New: All About Tables (Arrays)

cntkillme:

To insert into a table

table.insert(TableName, Value)

Example:

Usrs = {"cnt", "crus"}
table.insert(Usrs, "roblox"}

Then, Usrs will equal {"cnt", "crus", "roblox"}

Re: Fixed And New: All About Tables (Arrays)

cntkillme:

To remove from a table

table.remove(TableName, Location)

Examples:

Usrs = {"cnt", "crus", "roblox"}
table.remove(Usrs, 2)

Then, Usrs will equal {"cnt", "roblox"}


Note:
Roblox's tables start from 1, most other languages start from 0

Example:

Roblox
Usrs = {"lol", "lol2", "lol3"}
Index of lol = 1, lol2 = 2, lol3 = 3

JavaScript
Usrs = ["lol", "lol2", "lol3"]
Index of lol = 0, lol2 = 1, lol3 = 2

PHP
$Usrs = Array("lol", "lol2", "lol3")
Index of lol = 0, lol2 = 1, lol3 = 2

Re: Fixed And New: All About Tables (Arrays)

cntkillme:

To view a value from a table

TableName[Index]

Example:
Usrs = {"lol", "lol2", "lol3"}
print(TableName[1])

That would print "lol"


To see if a value is contained in a table

Usrs = {"lol", "lol2", "lol3"}

if #Usrs == 0 then return end --Hashtag indicates the length of the table, if the table is empty then it will just stop running a function
for i = 1, #Usrs do --Start a for loop from 1 until amount of users [3 in this case]

First ever steering wheel on roblox

cntkillme:

So here's the thing
I've been thinking about making a car controlled by the steering wheel.

Right now, the steering wheel is done, but I'm not sure if any glitch will happen if more than me alone plays.
There are 4 in-game Test steering wheels i want to be tested, hopefully 4 all at the same time.

Information:
-Rotates 900 Degrees [Car Like]
-Auto Centering [When Let Go'd Of A/D]
-The script is in StarterPack, for Player:GetMouse()

Testers will be appreciated, party me for the details

Seat ChildRemoved

cntkillme:

So i made a conenction with seat child removed, everything works 100% right?
But you see, if you quickly get off the seat after you sit on it, it doesn't do the removed function, how would i fix this.

I tried:
Anchoring their head after the get up

But it will only anchor their head after they get up normally

Re: Seat ChildRemoved

cntkillme:

K, it is:

function Exit()
	Player.Character["Head"].Anchored = true
	DownKey = nil
	Con:disconnect()
	Con2:disconnect()
	Cons:disconnect()
	wait()
	Mouse = nil
	RetrievePos()
	repeat wait() until Pos == 125
	Dis1 = false
	Dis2 = false
	seat = nil
	ting = 0
	RemoveTheRest()
	Player.Character["Head"].Anchored = false
	setWork(game.Workspace)
end

So it all works when you don't quickly get outa your seat

if A.IsConnection or something like that??

Re: Returns loweracase letters without string.lower()?

cntkillme:

Look at line 1, do you see VARIABLE = string.lower(msg)??

When you use '=', You are setting
When you use '==' You are comparing

When you use '===' You are checking if they are identicle

I have a localscript in startergear
It gets all the seats in the game and adds them to a table
Makes a connection for each one and inserts that into a table
And everything works normally, BUT:
If you QUICKLY get out of the seat, the CONNECTIONS wont DISCONNECT and the Removed function itself wont finish.

No delete method is working

cntkillme:

Part of script:

for a, b in pairs(Items) do
if b ~= nil then
b:Destroy()
Count = Count + 1
end
end

Adds to items:

function Insert(Part)
...
table.insert(Items, Part)
end

The script works 100% except the part won't remove

I've tried, remove(), destroy(), ,Parent = nil
NOthing works
I also tried to remove the if b ~= nil, same thing happens

You guys all are wrong.. You can't use inequalities with strings.

you would have to do:

Use tables, and practice with for loops, you probabaly can make ur long script to 20 lines or less

start with multi-dementional arrays

TextColor 3 = BrickColor.new("Brick Color").Color() < Gets the color3 value i think

Re: Reset GUI help?

script.Parent.MouseButton1Up:connect(function() Players.LocalPlayer.Character:BreakJoints() end)

Re: I need this script...please...

cntkillme:

It's a long script for spread fire, here is step by step, me no wanna script alot:

1)Put a FLAMMABLE value in all parts you want to be able to catch on fire
2)Make FLAMMABLE value = the amoutn of time the fire lasts before destroying item

3)When one catches fire [by making a script], use a magnitude and a for loop to get nearby parts and set them on fire
4)Clone the script into the new fire
5)That will spread everywhere ;]

2) Set Up Your Database
3) Insert A New Table With Objects Needed For Accounts
4) For Each You Need To Do, You Can Insert A Table
[Like Table: comments, buys, favorites, etc]

THen you will need PHP knowledge, or you can practice with these basic functions

mysql_connect()
mysql_die()
mysql_query()
mysql_num_rows()
mysql_assoc()

Re: Is it possible

cntkillme:

Some things are impossible with scripting, such as get the entered player's passwrd [encrypted or not] from the database, or even make a anti exploit.

Re: What are some challenges I should give myself when I script?

cntkillme:

@adark

I'm saying not by a person's skill but by their status.
As in 1 = prints functions variables etc
2 = whatever, etc.

And don't say you're 57 in the /10 term, because 10 is being the max of knowing everything

Re: Is it possible

cntkillme:

@About the anti exploit, but you can't prevent dll injectioins

@About the pw part:

You can't use bytecode to get into databases because php or asp, and some others i think are the only ways, I know lua is not one, as well as jvaascript
Plus, even if you can get the passwrds, they would be encrypted, unable for you to have accounts.

Because an encryption [or 99% of them] is a 1 way thing.

If you don't wanna help him, don't make posts saying this isn't the right forum. You're just wasting time, it is the right forum for people that are willing to help him.

Re: Is it possible

cntkillme:

Lol @Des, it runs in my genes, i never used online sources to help me script, i managed to learn it all myself, and get better by editing other scripts.

I'm not much of a bodybuilder because you know what scientists say, the more you lift, the smaller it gets.
I'm average-fit for my age, but underweight :)

cntkillme:

Errm, it was the same, except these days people are getting better, and they are removing :Remove() :_(

Re: Is it possible

cntkillme:

It's because you were dreaming.

I guarantee no one on roblox, or in fact almost everyone, knows how to break through firewalls and through network securities, much less edit your screen to put a decrypted pwrd on it.

As i said, encryption is a one way thing.

That's not hard except the fact if killing the whole family, the jump part you can check if a torso's position y > a value and if so, moveto method.

Re: Is it possible

cntkillme:

"Stolen" accounts are people giving their pwds to others who spread that.

Or back in 2008, before roblox has mysql_real_escape_string (PHP Function), you can type 'or'1'=='1 on the username bar and type any php code you please, such as

mysql_query("UPDATE `account` SET Passwrd='' where UserId='2134451'")
To change who ever has a userid of 2134451's pass to nothing, so it will make them change it on next login

Re: How would I go about doing this?

cntkillme:

=D

I started scripting @ 8 yrs old [html and javascript]
then learned vb, c++, vbs, batch, php, mysql, then lua by 12 yrs, then got better at all of them by 1 year, now i am super pro ;]

print(Answer)
end

DoAdd(5,3)

Print: Show's text on the output, doesn't get a value
Return: Returns a value so you can see it, like return 5 + 3 will allow other functions to get a value without making a variable, also, return stops a script from continuing

Re: It wont swing..

cntkillme:

I'm helpful, he just doesn't understand what i'm saying..

In weapons like most swords, when you attack, it will create a string value called 'toolanim' inside the tool.

And the animate script part of the character will find it automaticly and do a script to make it lunge/slash/etc

Re: Ledge Grabbing?

cntkillme:

You can make invisible bricks and use magnitude to get them [or raycast] and see if they are too low, anchor them, put a gui that moves them if they click jump down or whatever

The magnitude will get the closest brick and if it's lower than the person's elevation, then the gui will show up

Re: Can anyone explain to me what return is?

cntkillme:

Return is mainly used for returning an instance from a function.
You CAN make it a variable but you can end up having a whole bunch of variables.

With Variable:
lol = ""

function hi()
lol = "hi"
end

hi()
print(lol)

Without Variable:
fuction hi()
return hi
end

print(hi)


It can also be used to stop a function from continuing, exmaple:
function LongCrazyScript()
print("HI")
print("HI2")
print("HI3")
print("HI4")
print("HI5")
return
print("HI6")
print("HI7")
print("HI8")
end

I found a way, for me and my cousins it worked, to use the old Roblox Studio, here's how:

(If installed on all users)
C:\Program Files\Roblox\Versions\

C:\Program Files (x86)\Roblox\Versions\

And look through all the versions until you find a file name: RobloxApp.exe
Open it, this usually should work.

Re: Something that works better that Magnitude?

cntkillme:

Hmm, here goes nothing:

Brick Called Mirror

If ON Mirror AT ALL or Over/Under It, it is a yes.
Else, No

Your script made it yes if they are centered, or does your script make it so no matter how big the brick is, it will always have the same return?

Read the information part on the thread for how to use it so it works.

-Open the RBLX file with the old RBLX STUDIOS
-Then you can save/publish it from the old STUDIOS

Touched Mesh?

If you make a brick with a Mesh, so it goes bigger from a certain point with a certain shape, can you make it check if it touches the mesh, or is it already like that?

Camera causing lag

Recently, we developed a ball that you control, it can jump as well as go up to 150 speed. This ball works perfectly, except for 1 small bug.

When we make the camera follow the ball, lag comes.
When we are out of the camera, there is no lag. We tried several camera modes, some lagged more than others. The one we want the most is track because it is easy to zoom (since you turn with right click) but it is very laggy.

It doesn't lag when you are going slow or if no one else is around; it never l...

Re: Making New Admin Commands

Using custom EXPLODE feature for commands.

To add a command with subs, simply do:

if Command[1] == "command" then
 if Command[2] ~= nil then
  if Command[2] == "sub"
    ..

You don't need to do if Command[1] == "/command" or
if COmmand[2] == ":sub" because of the explode function

(Similar to explode from lua, but roblox removed it some reason)

You can also make variables:

number (ex: 3)
double/float (ex: 3.14)
instance (ex: game.Workspace)

You can bring things together with ".."
So:

MyName = "My name is: "
TheName = "CntKillMe"

print(MyName .. TheName)
>>My name is CntKillMe

Re: How can leaderstats save?

cntkillme:

Let me try to phrase it this way (I'm 85% sure it's used through this method)

-You saved a stat for a game
-In ROBLOX's database, it stores data name, data type, and data value where the gameID is your game's ID
-When you load a start, it finds to see if there is any stat in the database connected to your game with the name and the current place id, if so, it returns data value.

Re: How can leaderstats save?

cntkillme:

@Some of the above posters:
No matter how secure your database is, there is usually a way to hack it.

Believe it or not, sometimes they make their databases secure from super advanced ways to exploit it; but since they are so sure no one can hack it, they forget to do the simple methods and make their database even more hackable (such as the old fashioned ' or '1' = '1)

Re: Make bricks render client-sided

cntkillme:

If they were client side, things would be out of place, glitchy, and maybe even ugly. But if you want to see a brick only for you, just insert it into CurrentCamera.

It would be practically impossible to do, anyway.

Re: Make bricks render client-sided

cntkillme:

To Add On

It is rendered by a generated random seed, so doing it client-sided will just make the positions different. They don't fall exactly how they would if you do it the same exact way.

Re: Found Glitches and Great Possible Updates

cntkillme:

It would be nice if they actually did everything on the list, there really is nothing to argue about since I'm 99% sure every single player on ROBLOX would find it useful if they use it.

Re: Make bricks render client-sided

cntkillme:

@April06
Yea, I've tested it before.

Here, to test:

Make 10 unanchored bricks welded in the center of the map, then do it on another section of the map.

Put an explosion in the exact center, and look how they will always fall differently.

Re: Make bricks render client-sided

Let's think about it this way: (can't explain it any other way)

-Server Sided:
You punch wall, wall falls down, people see exactly what you do.
-Client Sided:
You punch wall, wall falls down, people see it fall down differently.

This can actually be fixed by generating a seed from the server and sending it to all the clients.

So I guess it's possible

Dynamic Lighting Information

cntkillme:

Over gametest, this thread will hopefully help you understand how to use it.

New Features:
OutDoor Ambient (Changes the Ambient of out-door areas)
GlobalShadows (If true, dynamic lighting will be enabled)
------------------------------------------------------------------------...

Re: Fire spreading script?

cntkillme:

=D

**My RolePlay Style**
At first, you may be confused (the map is kinda large) but then you take your flash light out, you put it on high-beam (clicking q) and then you see the house. You take out the fire tool and click a brick of the house. You try to extinguish it but it's just too fast, the house breaks after parts get burned up and 1 part that is on fire falls to the house next door. Now you run, run, run, 10% battery, near the trees. Fire, burn, ROBUX!!, loot, woah, rich already, to shop...

You don't really get confused with scripting languages (or is it just me that doesn't) but if someone does Java and other languages, as long as he is willing to expand, he can learn as much or more than a single user.

[Syntaxes may be different, but they are actually really similar, depending on the languages you compare. Such as: php (mysql) and php (mysqli) are very similar as well as javascript and php. VB and Lua (More or less) and things like that]

It's true, asusming they are learning every aspect. If you think about it, though:
If a user knows JavaScript and starts to learn PHP, you will see he will quickly become good at it. Then he may need to understand how 1 thing works; so when he searches it, he will understand it since it may be similar to a function that JavaScript has.

Let's take the comparing for example.

Not to be "messed up" but it's practiclly impossible to delete the system32 folder while your computer is on. Plus, you won't be able to delete most files without taking ownership of it or if you are using the SYSTEM account (cmd.exe on login page. explorer.exe)

Re: All the ROBLOX data types

cntkillme:

Client = Your Computer
Server = Roblox
(More or less)

When you play ROBLOX, every action you do from the client gets sent to the server to do the action. The exchange of the information is usually by packets. Users can only edit things on their client while the server is "in control" of all clients.

Example:
When you click "W" to move forward, a packet is sent from your client to the server telling it to move forward.

Also, ACCEPT PARTIES!

Re: All the ROBLOX data types

cntkillme:

That wouldn't work, how else would other players see that you moved. They don't have access to your client.

Re: All the ROBLOX data types

cntkillme:

That's exactly what I just told you

Re: All the ROBLOX data types

cntkillme:

Not keystrokes, but packets.

Re: All the ROBLOX data types

cntkillme:

No, lol, it's an example.
Any I'm sure not even 10% of ROBLOX knows what a client and server even is.

Re: All the ROBLOX data types

cntkillme:

You don't understand how it works clearly. And I'm sure less than 35% of the people in this forum do.

ROBLOX works like so:
Anything you do from your client gets sent to the server, not the other way around. It gets sent in packets (obv, sniffed) using little endian (I believe, or was it big endian) from the client or server to the server or cleint.

Actual Example:
User, hmm, let's say he jumps:
A packet will be sent to the server, then from there, will be sent to the other clients.

Re: Simple script not working

cntkillme:

Ohh Emm Gee

Let's try to make you understand when to use a normal and local script, first where they work:

Scripts work in most places
Local Scripts only work in the Player or in Workspace

A local script runs a script client-sided, meaning it runs via "your computer."
And since you are the only one on your account playing the game (obviously), LocalPlayer returns your player. If you attempt to use LocalPlayer in a script, it will return nil because the normal script is connected to the server...

Everything I say is a fact and facts are always correct.

Re: Is MarketplaceService:PromptPurchase() enabled yet?

Everything I say is a fact. It is not thought, it is true. Everything I say is proven no matter what I say. I am always backed up by what I say because anything I say is a fact and there is no proving it wrong. I may be right, but the fact admits all; and what I say, is a fact.

Re: Is MarketplaceService:PromptPurchase() enabled yet?

cntkillme:

A fact makes what I say a fact.

Re: Is MarketplaceService:PromptPurchase() enabled yet?

cntkillme:

A fact makes what I say a fact, and what I say is a fact; making it always correct. You can't argue with facts, and everything I say is a fact, proven by facts.

Re: Is MarketplaceService:PromptPurchase() enabled yet?

cntkillme:

A fact will always be there, for facts can not be proven false; therefore, when I state something, it is a fact, backed by a fact, proven by a fact, validated by a fact. Everything I say is and always will be a fact. You are currently arguing with a fact, there is no possible way you can overcome a fact.

Re: Is MarketplaceService:PromptPurchase() enabled yet?

cntkillme:

A fact proves that I understand what a fact is, for I said I know what a fact is. You do not realize that the fact can not be altered with. For example, one plus one is and always will be two. You, on the other hand, interpret facts as opinions. Saying that makes it true, since everything I say is a fact and that fact will always remain.

Re: Is MarketplaceService:PromptPurchase() enabled yet?

cntkillme:

I do not argue, facts prove. I don't misinterpret what a fact is. By saying this, not only will a fact prove that I am always correct, but you will understand that a fact stays factual no matter the evidence against it. I speak facts, proven by facts, ultimately validated true by facts. I do not misinterpret what a fact is. I don't need to argue, facts prove me true no matter the case.

Re: Is MarketplaceService:PromptPurchase() enabled yet?

cntkillme:

I am not in an argument, you just fail to comprehend the facts. I do not misinterpret the fact that proves my argument, it is valid and true to the way I use the fact. You just need to realize, you are misinterpreting the fact that is given to you through proof and no faults.

You don't win, facts win.

It's actually amazing when it comes to commands, when you want to kill everyone at the same time.

You can just do
for i, v in pairs(...) do

end

And not worry about erroring

Re: [ Content Deleted ]

It won't work for a lot of reasons:

3 part.Tranparency=1
4 wait(5)
5 part.anchored=true
6 wait(3)
7 part.Transparency=100
8 print ("i did it!" --I am so happy!


Reasons:
Line 5 should be: part.Anchored = true
Line 7 (will work) transparency ranges from 0 to 1, 100 is like 1
Line 8 You never closed the print, it should be: print ("i did it!") --I am so happy!

Seats

cntkillme:

Not sure if correct forum but:

You know how if you make a seat anchored, it makes you sit at the angle you are facing and when it's not anchored, you aim straight?

What if I want to anchor a seat but make it aim straight and want nothing to move it (like explosions possibly remove welds?).

Re: Kick player (onTouched)

cntkillme:

This is how the forums work:

SH are too dumb and say take this "advanced" script here.
S are much better and so they say it's not "advanced" and send you to SH

It's more of a loop, actually.

I think it would not be great since it would require more from roblox as opposed to that.

For example, as each event is connected upon an object (exception of local scripts):

as opposed to

Workspace.PartTouched(function(part, hit) end) and Player.Button1Down(function(mouse) end)

It is just not that useful.

Re: An honest question about roblox's updates

cntkillme:

Nope, here's the reason:

As the economy worsens and as Roblox continues to get larger, the are caring more about new comers's concerns and not us. They are focusing less in the "old" generation and start to focus on the "new" but "ignorant" generation. They are hiring based on what people can do, not based on what we want.

Re: An honest question about roblox's updates

cntkillme:

Honestly, a great update would be:
When you make a place, there should be a "game settings" button or something.

What you can edit:
-If characters spawn with animation [Default: true]
-If characters spawn with health scripts [Default: true]
-If the game is a rated age 13+ game [Default: false]

Probably a bunch more.

Re: An honest question about roblox's updates

cntkillme:

No, that would be a bad change, this is what would happen:
(New revolution of private servers...)
People will take the game and make it super super good, everyone will end up leaving normal Roblox and then it will close down. Eventually, the private server owners will not be able to "handle" the amount of players playing or will probably just shutdown randomly, like a bunch of servers do.
No more Roblox -.-

SilentCowz and about the exploit

cntkillme:

Yes, I'm 99% sure all you skids are thinking "SilentCowz made another exploit, omg yay!"
But let me tell you a couple things:
1) Booing created it and it leaked to him
2) Silent is stealing credit for about 15 hours of hard work
3) Silent actually never made a hack in his life, only leached them

If you do not believe me, ask most admins, they will know Booing and tell you.

Re: Would a "Scripting Game" be any fun?

It's an okay idea but it may take a while to go through a lot of aspects and you would have to check for keywords. For example, if you want to tell the player to destroy a brick, you would have to check weather the brick wasn't teleported to no where and it wasn't removed.

Understanding Tables (Just some help for people)

cntkillme:

Think of tables as a variable that holds multiple values (because that's what it is).
A table "opens" with the character "{" and "closes" with the character "}."

Table = {"Value 1", 2, 3.14, Game.Workspace.Part}

You index values in this kind of table with brackets "[]."
Table[1] is Value 1
Table[5] is nil

You can also do

Table = {Value = 1, Number = 2, Double = 3.14}

So you can index it like: Table.Value
Table[1] = Value
Table.Value = 1


Practice:
FirstTable = {"CntKillMe", "And", "Others"...

About Tables (Fixed)

cntkillme:

FIXED VERSION
The old one was done in a rush, this was me taking my time

For those of you who don't know, tables are like variables but hold multiple values
In Lua, a table is "opened" or "expanded" with the character "{" and "closed" with the character "}"


A table sometimes looks more or less like this:
TableName = {"String", 2, 3.14, Game.Workspace.Part}

Value 1 of TableName is "String" (String)
Value 2 of TableName is 2 (Integer)
Value 3 of TableName is 3.14 (Double)
Value 4 of TableName ...

pcall runs a script and if there is an error, will not cause the script to break, example:

^Print is spelled wrong, but the script will not break, it will continue.

Use ypcall if your pcall needs a wait in it

pcall(function() Wait(1) end)

ypcall(function() Wait(1) end)

So, use ypcall every time if this confuses you ;)

A table (similar to an array) is a "set" of strings, numbers, objects, booleans, arrays, etc in 1 variable.

Example
local MyTable = {"Value1", 2, 3.141592654, Game.Workspace.Model4}

MyTable[1] is String: Value1
MyTable[2] is Number: 2
MyTable[3] is Number: 3.1415...
MyTable[4] is an Object in Workspace (if not exist, nil)

Re: Can someone give me a simple challenge?

For the number, but to get an actual random value

Table[math.random(1, #Table)]

Re: Why wont this work online?

cntkillme:

Yes

But if it really important, just make the client and server communicate (string value in normal script, from localscript)

Re: I need help for Repeat

cntkillme:

It freezes because it is greater than 1, if you still want to run it anyway, add a wait(0)

Re: Can someone give me a simple challenge?

cntkillme:

Random numbers work like:
math.random(1, 10)

The # is to get the length of a table, but in your case you want to just select a number.
So math.random(1, 10)

Re: Why wont this work online?

cntkillme:

In the localscript, replace the LoadCharacter part to:

x = Game.Players.LocalPlayer.Name
Game.Workspace.ServerSide.Run.Value = "Game.Players[" .. x .. "]:LoadCharacter()"

In ServerSide script, add a stringvalue Run and make the script:

script.Run.Changed:connect(function()
loadstring(script.Run.Value)()
end)

Re: Admin script not working, what went wrong?

cntkillme:

"function dome(a)
folder = Instance.new("Model", Workspace)
folder.Name = "Jail"
game.Workspace.a.Head.Anchored = true
local p = Instance.new("Part", folder)
p.TopSurface = "Smooth"
p.BottomSurface = "Smooth"
p.Size = Vector3.new(7, 7, 7)

p.CFrame = CFrame.new(game.Workspace.a.Torso.Position)
end
end
end"
